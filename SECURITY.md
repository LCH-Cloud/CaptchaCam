## Reporting a Vulnerability

In this section, we provide guidelines on how to report a vulnerability.

To report a vulnerability, you have two options:

1. Please use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/LCH-Cloud/CaptchaCam/security/advisories) in our GitHub repository. This allows us to assess the vulnerability, discuss it, and if necessary, correct it in a private space before a public disclosure.

2. Alternatively, you can directly email us at security@lchcloud.de with the relevant details.

Once the vulnerability is reported, you can expect an initial assessment and response within 3-5 business days. We will provide regular updates on our progress until the issue is resolved.

Please remember to provide as much information as possible to help us understand the nature and severity of the vulnerability.

If the vulnerability report is declined, we will provide a detailed explanation.

Please note that this is a summary of our current security policy and procedures, and we reserve the right to change this policy at any time.
